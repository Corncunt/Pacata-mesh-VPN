# Pacata Mesh VPN

## Overview

Pacata Mesh VPN is a decentralized, peer-to-peer virtual private network that integrates its own cryptocurrency system called "Pacata." The project aims to create a resilient, censorship-resistant network where users can securely connect while participating in a tokenized economy that rewards bandwidth sharing and network support.

By leveraging mesh networking principles, Pacata Mesh VPN eliminates central points of failure and creates a self-sustaining ecosystem where participants are incentivized to contribute resources to strengthen the network.

## Key Features

- **Fully Decentralized Architecture**: No central servers or authorities controlling the network
- **Encrypted P2P Connections**: Secure tunneling with TLS/AES encryption
- **NAT Traversal**: Connect with peers regardless of network configuration
- **Distributed Discovery**: Find other nodes through DHT or gossip protocols
- **Economic Incentives**: Earn Pacata tokens by providing bandwidth and reliability
- **Bandwidth Marketplace**: Pay for premium speeds and services using cryptocurrency
- **Developer Sustainability**: Small developer fees help maintain the network
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Designed for Linux distributions with simple installation

## Pacata Cryptocurrency

Pacata is the native cryptocurrency that powers the economic model of the mesh VPN:

- **Earned by**: Providing bandwidth, relay services, and maintaining good uptime
- **Spent on**: Premium speeds, priority routing, and advanced features
- **Transactions**: Secured on a distributed ledger with minimal resource requirements
- **Validation**: Uses a consensus mechanism for transaction verification

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Linux operating system (RPM or DEB based distribution)
- Internet connection with reasonable bandwidth

### Installation

#### From Source

1. Clone the repository:
   ```

   cd pacata-mesh-vpn
   ```

2. Set up a virtual environment:
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run the setup script:
   ```
   python setup.py install
   ```

#### Using Package Manager (When Available)
